About This Script
===============================
ec2-manage-snapshots is a php command line script that removes Amazon EBS snapshots older than one week for a given volume. While pruning, the script keeps one backup from every Sunday for the previous four weeks, and backups from the first of everymonth previous.

This script is a rewrite from http://www.thecloudsaga.com/aws-ec2-manage-snapshots/, but with improvements.

What's New
===============================
    * A complete rewrite using Zend Framework and object oriented design
    * Accounts for more than one backup a day
    * Uses Amazon's newest API provided in Zend Framework
    * Addresses snapshots which are in use by AMI images
    * Access key and secret key can now be included as command line arguments
    * Configuration parameters have been moved outside of the script
    * Added validation for amazon regions with graceful exit when an incorrect region is supplied
    * Added a quiet mode to suppress output
